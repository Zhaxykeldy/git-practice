She told me that i'm not enough
And she left me with a broken hearth
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred
Now there's too many thoughts goin' through my brain
And now I'm takin' these shots like it's novacaine

Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, I fall apart
Down to my core

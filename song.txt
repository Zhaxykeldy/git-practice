She told me that i'm not enough,
And she left me with a broken heart,
She fooled me twice and it's all my fault
She cut too deep, now she left me scarred,
Now there's too many thoughts going through my brain
And now i'm taking' these shots like it's novacaine

Oooh, i fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, i fall apart
Down to my core
Oooh, didn't know it before
Surprised when you caught me off guard
All this damn jewelry i bought
You was my shortly, i thought

Naver caught a feelin' this hard
Harder than a liquor I pour
Tell me you don't want me no more
But I can't let go
Everybody told me,so
Feelin' like I sold my soul
Devil in the form of a wh*re
Devil in the form of a wh*re
You said it
No, you said it
No, you said it (that shit)
We'd be together
